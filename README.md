# AngularTestingOverview

This project is the source code for the presentation on Angular Unit Tesing. It contains a simple demo showing how to make unit tests in Angular 6. It's largely based on the Jasmine and Angular documentation.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
